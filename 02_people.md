 </div>

Megan (she/her) is currently an Assistant Professor in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Toronto. Previously, she was a postdoctoral researcher in the Evolution and Ecology Department at UC Davis, where she worked with [Jenny Gremer](https://gremerlab.wordpress.com/), [Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/), [Annie Schmitt](https://plantgxe.ucdavis.edu/), and [Sharon Strauss](https://sharonstrauss.wordpress.com/). She did her PhD research in the Biodiversity Research Centre and Botany Department at the University of British Columbia with [Amy Angert](http://angert.botany.ubc.ca/home.html). This work included field experiments, population genetics, herbarium studies, and quantitative syntheses of the literature. She did her undergraduate work at the UC Santa Cruz, where she worked in the [Parker](http://parker.eeb.ucsc.edu/) and [Kay](https://kay.eeb.ucsc.edu/) labs, after transferring from Cabrillo Community College. In her spare time she likes to explore parks with her 2-year old, try new recipes, and hang out with her two weird cats.

Louisa (she/her) is a PhD student and current [W. Thomas Smith Scholar](https://www.davidson.edu/news/2022/05/13/powered-plants-louisa-bartkovich-22-named-smith-scholar). She is broadly interested in exploring the processes that enable plant resilience to novel environmental conditions to aid and inform community-based initiatives. Prior to beginning her PhD, Louisa completed her undergraduate degree at Davidson College studying plant ecology and environmental humanities. She loves being the older sister to eight siblings and enjoys collecting quirky earrings, pottery, and pocket notebooks. Her twitter ([@loubartkovich](https://twitter.com/loubartkovich)) is a curation of what helps her smile, think, and laugh.
