My research focuses on understanding the factors that shape geographic ranges, how populations adapt to their environments, and how species will respond to climate change. I approach these questions using a variety of methods, including large-scale field experiments, meta-analysis, landscape genomics, and climatic niche modelling.

I’m currently a **postdoc in the Evolution and Ecology Department at UC Davis**, where I’m working with [Sharon Strauss](https://sharonstrauss.wordpress.com/), [Annie Schmitt](https://plantgxe.ucdavis.edu/), [Jenny Gremer](https://gremerlab.wordpress.com/), and [Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/). My postdoctoral work focuses on:
- How have life-history cues diversified across California's jewelflowers (*Streptanthus*)? We are investigating how germination and flowering phenology respond to climate.
- How have populations of *Streptanthus tortuosus* diverged across a wide elevational range? We are quantifying vernalization requirements and estimating their heritability, as well as investigating whether populations exhibit adaptive divergence in floral and germination traits.

I did my **PhD research in the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia** with [Amy Angert](http://angert.botany.ubc.ca/home.html). In my thesis research, I studied how climate, gene flow, and mating system shape the geographic range of an annual wildflower, *Clarkia pulchella*, in the interior of the Pacific Northwest.

I did my **undergraduate work at the UC Santa Cruz**, where I worked in the [Parker](http://parker.eeb.ucsc.edu/) and [Kay](https://kay.eeb.ucsc.edu/) labs.
