Our research focuses on how ecology and evolution interact to shape speciesâ€™ geographic ranges. We conduct large-scale, rigorous field and greenhouse experiments, quantitative syntheses of the the literature, and analyses using natural history collections.

**In July 2022, I'll be starting a lab in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Toronto (St. George campus).** Research in my lab will focus on investigating the drivers of local adaptation and the evolutionary forces shaping geographic ranges.

<br>

**I am recruiting graduate students for September 2022.** If you are interested in joining my lab, please check out the information on the [join](https://meganbontrager.github.io/join/) page and get in touch with me via email! I am also very happy to hear from prospective undergraduates and postdocs.
