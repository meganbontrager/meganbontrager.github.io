Our research focuses on how ecology and evolution interact to shape speciesâ€™ geographic ranges. We conduct large-scale, rigorous field and greenhouse experiments, quantitative syntheses of the the literature, and analyses using natural history collections. Our group is located on the St. George campus of the University of Toronto.
