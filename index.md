My research focuses on how ecology and evolution interact to shape species’ geographic ranges. I conduct large-scale, rigorous field and greenhouse experiments, quantitative syntheses of the the literature, and analyses using natural history collections.

I’ve just started as a postdoc in the **Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Toronto**, where I'll be hanging out with the [Stinchcombe Lab](https://stinchcombe.eeb.utoronto.ca/). In this position I'll be starting new projects investigating the drivers of local adaptation and the evolutionary forces shaping geographic ranges.

<br>
I'm also continuing collaborations with my previous postdoc team in the **Evolution and Ecology Department at UC Davis**, where I worked with [Jenny Gremer](https://gremerlab.wordpress.com/), [Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/), [Annie Schmitt](https://plantgxe.ucdavis.edu/), and [Sharon Strauss](https://sharonstrauss.wordpress.com/). This work focuses on:

- How have life-history cues diversified across California's jewelflowers (*Streptanthus*)?
- How have populations of *Streptanthus tortuosus* diverged across a wide elevational range?


<br>
I did my **PhD research in the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia** with [Amy Angert](http://angert.botany.ubc.ca/home.html). This work included field experiments, population genetics, herbarium studies, and quantitative syntheses of the literature, investigating:

- How do contemporary climate change and altered biotic interactions affect local adaptation?
- How does gene flow affect range edge populations of *Clarkia pulchella*?
- How do local adaptation and population quality vary across geographic ranges?
- How have climate and geographic range position shaped the mating system of *Clarkia pulchella*?


<br>
I did my **undergraduate work at the UC Santa Cruz**, where I worked in the [Parker](http://parker.eeb.ucsc.edu/) and [Kay](https://kay.eeb.ucsc.edu/) labs.
