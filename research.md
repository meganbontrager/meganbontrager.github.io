### **Adaptation and gene flow at geographic range margins**

#### **Testing effects of gene flow on marginal populations in the field**

Theory offers several competing predictions about the effects of gene flow on range edge populations. One possibility is that gene flow from populations in different environments may disrupt local adaptation in edge populations. An alternative possibility is that edge populations may lack the genetic variation necessary for them to adapt to their local environment, in which case, gene flow may provide beneficial genetic variation. A further complicating factor in the era of climate change is that populations now need to track a rapidly changing environment. To examine how gene flow from a variety of climatic and geographic distances affects northern edge populations of *Clarkia pulchella*, I simulated gene flow between populations and planted the resulting seeds into common gardens at the northern range edge.

We found that the best performing populations were those that were most closely matched to the warm weather during the experiment. Gene flow from these warm populations improved performance of the local populations. The effects of gene flow were also positively correlated with the genetic differentiation of the parental populations.

#### **Does local adaptation strengthen or weaken at range margins?**

A key hypothesis for why evolutionarily stable range limits exist is that populations near range edges are inhibited from becoming well-adapted to their environment due to smaller effective population sizes or swamping gene flow. On the other hand, populations at the edge of a species’ range may occupy unique environments, and therefore if they are locally adapted they may be of greater conservation value than central populations. We compiled a database of transplant studies and used these data along with geographic range information to see whether the magnitude of local advantage varied predictable with proximity to geographic or elevational range edges. Rather than showing a strong spatial signal, our results suggest that climatic marginality is a better predictor of the magnitude of local advantage. We're writing these results up now - stay tuned.

### **Local adaptation under anomalous climates**

Common garden and transplant experiments are frequently employed to test whether populations are adapted to their environments. As the climate changes, populations will more frequently experience climate that differs from the conditions that they have adapted to. Amy Angert and I are leading an effort to see if there is already a signal of climate change disrupting local adaptation in published studies. We’ve expanded existing databases of transplant studies, and we’re using climate and fitness data to test how signatures of local adaptation have changed over time and in relation to climate anomalies. We’ll be presenting some exciting results at upcoming conferences, so stay tuned.
