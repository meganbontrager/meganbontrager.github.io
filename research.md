### **Adaptation and gene flow at geographic range margins**

#### **Testing effects of gene flow on marginal populations in the field**

Theory offers several competing predictions about the effects of gene flow on range edge populations. One possibility is that gene flow from populations in different environments may disrupt local adaptation in edge populations. An alternative possibility is that edge populations may lack the genetic variation necessary for them to adapt to their local environment, in which case, gene flow may provide beneficial genetic variation. A further complicating factor in the era of climate change is that populations now need to track a rapidly changing environment. To examine how gene flow from a variety of climatic and geographic distances affects northern edge populations of *Clarkia pulchella*, I simulated gene flow between populations and planted the resulting seeds into common gardens at the northern range edge.

### **Local adaptation under anomalous climates**

Common garden and transplant experiments are frequently employed to test whether populations are adapted to their environments. As the climate changes, populations will more frequently experience climate that differs from the conditions that they have adapted to. Amy Angert and I are leading an effort to see if there is already a signal of climate change disrupting local adaptation in published studies. We’ve expanded existing databases of transplant studies, and we’re using climate and fitness data to test how signatures of local adaptation have changed over time and in relation to climate anomalies. We’ll be presenting some exciting results at upcoming conferences, so stay tuned.
